							<h4>Customer Profiles & Personas</h4>
							<p>A customer profile can be created based on your analytics data, which can showcase large groups of customers that have specific traits (such as age, gender, income, children, marital status, and spending habits). While a customer profile is purely data driven, a customer persona is a fictitious narrative about your customer that contains more granular details than the profile, addressing such things as interests, habits, and location. Personas are often helpful when working on creating a voice and tone for your product or service. </p>
							<h4>Desirability Analysis</h4>
							<p>A desirability analysis focuses on the effectiveness of your visual design based on the emotional response of the customer.

Usability testing can be conducted either in-person or remotely to understand user attitudes and behaviors when engaging with an experience(s).</p>
