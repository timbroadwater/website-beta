				<h2>Supporting Nonprofits</h2>
				<p>It’s not uncommon for organizations (both small and large) to promote design over research. After all, research takes time, it usually costs money, and you’ve got to have data specialists to conduct the study and analyze the results. But unfortunately, overlooking data discovery in favor of jumping head-first into a design project can have pretty drastic consequences -- the most significant being that you delivered a product that doesn’t meet your user’s expectations. Now, you’re back to square one and you have to rethink your entire product strategy, and likely invest more time and money, in order to improve the project that you’ve already launched.</p>
				<p>This is where we come into play. User Goodness is here to help support nonprofits and their missions. We offer the complete package, a consultancy service that addresses both research and design to get you the results you want at a fraction of the cost compared to working with the other guys.  </p>
