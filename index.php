				<h2>History of UX</h2>
				<p>UX is over 500 years old… and still kickin’ it!</p>
				<p>UX principles have been traced back to before the Renaissance era [source?], but didn’t find a name until 1995, when Don Norman¹ asked to be called a UX Architect when he joined Apple’s research and design department focused on human-centered products [name of department may sound more important?]. Over the next 23 years, UX became the Queen Bee of methodologies for studying the interactions between humans and technology.</p>
