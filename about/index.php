				<h2><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Vision</h2>
				<p>Our Vision at UserGoodness is based on three core principles:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="dark">We welcome any business or organization.</span> No matter how big or small, no one will be turned away based on size or financial holdings.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="dark">We believe in supporting the customer and the business or organization.</span> We do this by understanding the needs of the customer and how those needs align with the goals of the business or organization.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="dark">We support friendly partnerships with businesses or organizations.</span> We’re not here to boss you around and tell you all about the things that you’re doing wrong with your end-users. Remember, we’re committed to helping you improve what you already have!
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> Mission</h2>
				<p>Our mission at UserGoodness is all about delivering data-driven designs and insights to strengthen the partnership between business / organization and their customers. We do this through a simple conversation to get to know you and your business / organization goals and see if we might work well together.</p>
