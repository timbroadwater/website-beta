				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>Our mission at User Goodness is all about delivering data-driven designs and insights to strengthen the partnership between nonprofits and the communities that they serve. We do this through a simple conversation to get to know you and your business goals and see if we might work well together. So, if your nonprofit has not quite achieved the status that you want, then please read on…</p>
				<p>Our research, design, development, and content team has some wicked good skills with a combined 40 years of work experience in the study and practical application of user experience. We have experience in the eCommerce, Healthcare, Cultural Arts, Environmental Science, Higher Education, Non-Profit, and Small Business sectors. We’ve been around the block, or rather the industry, and have equipped ourselves nicely with tools and methods to tackle any curveball you might throw at us.</p>
