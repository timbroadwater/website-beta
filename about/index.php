				<h2>Vision</h2>
				<p>Our Vision at User Goodness is based on three core principles:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="orange">We Welcome Any Business or Organization.</span> No matter how big or small, no one will be turned away based on size or financial holdings.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="orange">We Believe in Improving the General Welfare of Nonprofits.</span> All causes matter to us, whether you’re helping restore the environment, providing for the disadvantaged, or finding homes for abandoned animals, we want to help support your mission!
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="orange">We Support Friendly Partnerships with Nonprofits.</span> We’re not here to boss you around and tell you all about the things that you’re doing wrong with your end-users. Remember, we’re committed to helping you improve what you already have!
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Mission</h2>
				<p>Our mission at User Goodness is all about delivering data-driven designs and insights to strengthen the partnership between nonprofits and the communities that they serve. We do this through a simple conversation to get to know you and your business goals and see if we might work well together.</p>
