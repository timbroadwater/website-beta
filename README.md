# User Goodness Website

The [User Goodness website](http://www.usergoodness.com) is a responsive website that utilizes:

* [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
* jQuery
* PHP
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

To get up and running do the following:
1. Download and install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html)
2. Download updated version of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
3. Download whatever LAMP or web development Vagrant Box you want. I suggest https://box.scotch.io/.
