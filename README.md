# UserGoodness Website

The [UserGoodness website](http://www.usergoodness.com) is a responsive website that utilizes:

* [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
* jQuery
* PHP
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

To get up and running do the following:
1. Download and install [Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html)
2. Download updated version of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

You can download whatever Vagrant Box you want, but the easiest is https://box.scotch.io/ in my opinion. 

* If you used Scotch Box, go to http://192.168.33.10/ afer it's setup.

* To view a bunch from Vagrant, create an account at https://www.vagrantup.com. A good one may be the [Trusty64 Vagrant Box](https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64), and follow the command line instructions.
